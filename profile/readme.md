## 🤔 About us
The people with big dreams. We are building open source projects with strong **focus on user privacy**. Our goal is to make the Internet **more secure**. In our applications everything is encrypted - __in fact even we don't have access to users' data__. 


## 🥂 Our Dreams
- We want to make the Internet **more private**.
- We want to **encrypt everything**, even pictures of cute kitties
- We want our services to be **available to everyone**, **for free!**

## 😍 Want to join our team?
Sorry, unfortunately we are currently not inviting contributors.<br/>

Stay tuned ❤️!
